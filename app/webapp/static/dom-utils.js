// Bind a document-level pointerdown listener that closes a popover on any
// tap outside `box` (and outside `toggle`, when given — so re-tapping the
// button that opened the popover doesn't immediately re-close it; the
// opening tap's pointerdown has already fired by the time the popover is
// shown and this binds, so the `contains()` guards exist only to cover a
// tap on the toggle button itself). Returns a disposer that removes the
// listener — call it once, on close. Callers are still responsible for
// guarding against double-binding (skip calling this again while already
// open) and for calling the returned disposer before re-binding.
